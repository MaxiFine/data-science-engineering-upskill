# BOOK SUMMARY

- CHAPTER 1

## Context

- Attention and time should be paid to understanding the **context** for the need to communicate.

- **Exploratory** analysis is what you do to
understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight
to others.

- When we’re at the point of communicating
our analysis to our audience, that is **explanatory** space, meaning
you have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell—probably
about those two pearls.

## Context Takeaways

- First, To **whom** are you communicating? It is important to have a good understanding of who your audience is and how they perceive you.
- **What** do you want your audience to know or do?
- **How** can you use data to help make your point?
- What **tone** do you want your communication to set? [Are you celebrating a success Trying to light a fire to drive action? Is the topic lighthearted or serious?]

## Narrowing Storytelling Techinique

**3-minute story**
The 3-minute story is exactly that: if you had only three minutes to tell your audience
what they need to know, what would you say?

## The Big Idea

- The Big Idea boils the so-what down even further: to a single sentence.

## The Big Idea has three components

1. It must articulate your unique point of view;
2. It must convey what’s at stake; and
3. It must be a complete sentence.

## Storyboarding

- Storyboarding is perhaps the single most important thing you can do up front to ensure
the communication you craft is on point. 
- The storyboard establishes a structure for your communication.
- Helps to identify the pieces of the data and the story to tell together. 

## CHAPTER 1

**CHOOSING AN EFFECTIVE VISUAL*

- There are many different graphs and other types of visual displays of information, but a handful will work for the majority of your needs.
- When you have just a number or two to share, *simple text* can be a great way to communicate.
- Tables are great for just that—communicating to a mixed audience whose members will each look for their particular row of interest.
- One approach for mixing the detail you can include in a table while also making use of
visual cues is via a heatmap.
- **Line graphs** are most commonly used to plot continuous data.
- **Slopegraphs** can be useful when you have two time periods or points of comparison and want to quickly show relative increases and decreases or differences across various categories between the two data points.
- **Bar** charts should be leveraged because they are common, as this means less of a learning curve for your audience. [**Zero baseline and Non-zero baseline.**]
- The **waterfall chart** can be used to pull apart the pieces of a stacked bar chart to focus on one at a time, or to show a starting point, increases and decreases, and the resulting ending point.
- **Stacked horizontal** bar charts can be used to show the totals across different categories but also give a sense of the subcomponent pieces. They can be structured to show either absolute values or sum to 100%.
- **Stacked vertical bar chart** Use cases for stacked vertical bar charts are more limited. They are meant to allow you to compare totals across categories and also see the subcomponent pieces within a given category.
- **Stacked horizontal bar chart** Similar to the stacked vertical bar chart, stacked horizontal bar charts can be used to show the totals across different categories but also give a sense of the subcomponent pieces.
- **Area Graph** when you need to visualize numbers of vastly different magnitudes.
