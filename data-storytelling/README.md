# BOOK SUMMARY

- CHAPTER 1

## Context

- Attention and time should be paid to understanding the **context** for the need to communicate.

- **Exploratory** analysis is what you do to
understand the data and figure out what might be noteworthy or interesting to highlight
to others.

- When we’re at the point of communicating
our analysis to our audience, that is **explanatory** space, meaning
you have a specific thing you want to explain, a specific story you want to tell—probably
about those two pearls.

## Context Takeaways

- First, To **whom** are you communicating? It is important to have a good understanding of who your audience is and how they perceive you.
- **What** do you want your audience to know or do?
- **How** can you use data to help make your point?
- What **tone** do you want your communication to set? [Are you celebrating a success Trying to light a fire to drive action? Is the topic lighthearted or serious?]

Narrowing Storytelling Techinique
**3-minute story**
The 3-minute story is exactly that: if you had only three minutes to tell your audience
what they need to know, what would you say?

## The Big Idea

- The Big Idea boils the so-what down even further: to a single sentence.

## The Big Idea has three components

1. It must articulate your unique point of view;
2. It must convey what’s at stake; and
3. It must be a complete sentence.

## Storyboarding

- Storyboarding is perhaps the single most important thing you can do up front to ensure
the communication you craft is on point. 
- The storyboard establishes a structure for your communication.
- Helps to identify the pieces of the data and the story to tell together.
